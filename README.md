## Overview

UneasyVanilla is a semi-anarchy/survival minecraft server, started on the 10th of March 2020, designed to give players total freedom to play Minecraft just as the developers intended.

We're not anarchy, rather more lawless than anything else. You can do whatever you want in-game as long as you follow a few simple rules. If you want the full range of survival game play in a setting where someone might just be waiting behind any nether portal to kill you, where you can build or say anything you possibly could ever want, where the only staff interaction is to ban cheaters and make sure the server is running well, then this is your spot.
