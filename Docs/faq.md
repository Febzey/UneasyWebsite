### Mechanic Informations.

Farms / mechanics that are different from Vanilla.

#### IronFarm / Villager lobotomize
- Different from vanilla is that Villager need to switch between doing Villager stuff and being scared.
	- Take the following things into consideration when you're designing your farm:
		- You need to make sure that the villager state switching isn't too fast (Idle, Panic).
        - Villager need to have atleast 2 block of movable area (AIR BLOCK) to not be lobotomize.
        - Make sure villager are both standing on a fullblock and block around them are full block for villager to not get lobotomize.

- Trading halls.
	- Villager Optimization (Required for everyone to do)
		- Villagers eat up a lot of server resources, which you can help save by optimizing them.
	- To lobotomize your villagers:
		- Build a wall around the villager to make them not able to move, pathfind (1x1 Trading hall style)
	- To Un-lobotomize your villagers:
		- Make so that the villager are able to move or have atleast 2x1 of movable area.
