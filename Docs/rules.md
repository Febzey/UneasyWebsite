## General Server Rules

 - No lag machines or deliberate overuse of server resources.
	 - Intentionally lagging the server or creating stress on the server and ruins the experience of the Player on the server is NOT allowed.
	 - Designing/Building a machine/mechanism in a hugely inefficient manner with intention to cause lag to the server is NOT allowed (This might not result in a ban, but we will inform you of the inefficient and might have you take it down or rebuild it.)
 - No use of hacked clients, external programs, X-Ray texture packs or radar.
	- Hacked client: these are clients that offer or give more advantage for anyone that used them and therefore are NOT allowed on the server.
	- Using an external program such as Macro, auto clicker while PvPing is also NOT allowed since it gives more advantage than normal. You can use an auto clicker for farms, providing it doesn't spam clicks super fast.
	- Using a world download, replay mod or other illegimate means to get locations for structures, blocks, entity, etc.
	- Any type of radar or tracer that shows Player*, Entity*, Tiles*, Ores*, etc. 
	- If what you're doing looks like X-Ray or ESP, We'll treat it as such. For example: composter glitching, pieray, "glitching" player model inside a block in any way to look for underground structures, caves, etc. Appeal reason will not be valid unless there is solid proof on the player side.
 - No doxxing or real life threatening.
	- Any type of doxxing, threatening of doxxing or using in real life info, threaten someone, both inside and outside of the UneasyVanilla Minecraft & Discord server should be reported to the admin of that server and action will be taken on both the UneasyVanilla Minecraft and Discord server.
	- We have a zero tolerance policy on doxxing and real life threatening, breaking this rule will result in a permanent ban from both the UneasyVanilla Minecraft server and Discord server.
 - No use of exploits or duping.
	- Using an exploit to gain advantages over other players is NOT allowed.
	- Using an exploit or mechanic to restrict an account(s)/player(s) from playing the game.
	- Only type of duping that is allowed on the server are TNTs, Carpets, Rails.
