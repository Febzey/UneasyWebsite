### Mechanic Information.

Farms / mechanics that are different from Vanilla.

#### IronFarm / Villager lobotomization
- Different from vanilla is that villagers need to switch between doing villager stuff and being scared.
	- Take the following things into consideration when you're designing your farm:
		- You need to make sure that the villager state switching isn't too fast (Idle, Panic).
        - Villagers need to have atleast 2 blocks of movable area (AIR BLOCK) to not be lobotomized. Beds are not air blocks.
        - Make sure the villagers are both standing on a full block, and the blocks around them are full blocks for villagers to not get lobotomized.

- Trading halls.
	- Villager Optimization (Required for everyone to do)
		- Villagers eat up a lot of server resources, which you can help save by optimizing them.
	- To lobotomize your villagers:
		- Build a wall around the villager to make them unable to move or pathfind (1x1 Trading hall style)
	- To de-lobotomize your villagers:
		- Make it so that the villagers are able to move or have atleast 2x1 of movable area.
